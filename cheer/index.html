<body>I have been Co-ed stunting for 1.5 years. My stunt partner was usually my brother, but now I just stunt mainly with guys from Weber State.  I started with beginning skills, now I am more on elite skills.</body>
	  <h1> Spotlight: My brother</h1>
	  <body> My brother Nate is a big part of why I joined cheer. He decided he was trying out in Febuary 2024, this inspired me to try out as well. My brother is the first one who ever taught me how to co ed stunt. We started from very simple skills and worked very hard to improve. Me and Nate took privates, we went to the gym, and we practiced over and over again. Me and my brother were stunting partners until he left on his mission. </body>
